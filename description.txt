Tired of trying your luck with strange plants and the dye trader? Look no further! Now you can craft strange dyes yourself (only those obtained as strange plant rewards) with strange plants and (rather numerous) relevant materials.

Recipes are made available the same way as you'd unlock strange dyes in the base game to keep progress consistent.
